1- Problema na leitura do pc_buffer: Ã© preciso fazer 1 write pc_buffer
2- Implement operations apart from tfs_mount on the server side: refactor code so that it calls a function for each operation
3- Improve tfs_server.c: add checks that the session_id is active
5- Note that right now we are ignoring the session_id and not serialising it: once we move to the multithreaded server, we need to serialise it in the main function
6- Make sure the client writes atomically to the pipe
7- Make sure we can't connect more than S sessions in the main thread
8- Close read_fds in main thread at the end of the thread, or at unmount
9- Notar que dos commits de 5 janeiro para 6 eu retirei algumas coisas em caso de erro dentro das threads (close read_fd e unlink pipename). Ver se isso faz sentido

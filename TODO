1- Implement operations apart from tfs_mount on the server side: refactor code so that it calls a function for each operation
START with 2 because it is in the middle
2- Improve operations.c: global variable to see if the fs is initialized with a check on each function,
and switch the mutex to static allocation
3- Improve tfs_server.c: add checks that the session_id is active
5- Note that right now we are ignoring the session_id and not serialising it: once we move to the multithreaded server, we need to serialise it in the main function
6- Make sure the client writes atomically to the pipe
